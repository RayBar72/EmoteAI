EmoteAI is an advanced emotion recognition system leveraging the power of neural networks. By analyzing facial expressions, our system provides real-time feedback on the detected emotions.

## Features
- Real-time emotion detection
- Supports seven primary emotions: Happy, Sad, Angry, Surprised, Neutral, Disgusted, Afraid
- Robust to varying lighting conditions and diverse facial features

## Data
The EmoteAI model was trained on the FER2013 dataset. This dataset consists of 48x48 pixel grayscale images of faces, categorized into one of the seven emotion labels.

## Ethical Considerations
We prioritize user privacy and data protection. EmoteAI doesn't store facial images or emotion data. The system performs analysis in real-time and doesn't retain any personal data.
